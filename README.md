Website redesign for a restaurant

A portfolio project that displays my proficiency with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and my ability to work with a designer. I chose to redesign this website to highlight my ability to see what can be improved on a restaurant website
that is obscure and has slow loading times, to increase traffic flow and business to the restaurant, as well as tell a more cohesive narrative.
